## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm a backend developer who enjoys building systems that are secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
What excites me most is the process of solving problems ‚Äî breaking them down, exploring possibilities, and finding the right solution.  
I have a natural curiosity for technology and enjoy diving into new tools and concepts, learning them deeply, and seeing how they can improve the work I do.  
For me, development isn‚Äôt just about writing code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating solutions that make a difference, working closely with others, and constantly growing along the way.
